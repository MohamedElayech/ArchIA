# PCD Project

This project is a toolset for modeling, processing, and visualizing architectural concepts from natural language inputs. It converts user-provided architecture-related descriptions into structured models and generates Draw.io diagrams automatically.

The system uses:
- **Flask** to expose an API  
- **OpenAI** for semantic understanding  
- **NetworkX** for internal graph modeling  
- **Graphviz** to generate Draw.io-compatible visuals

---

## Purpose

The project allows users to input architectural ideas in plain text, and get back structured diagrams showing Stakeholders, Goals, Principles, Constraints, and more, automatically laid out in Draw.io.
